* Package version numbering

Our software has version numbers like

1.2.3a20170328 for dated snapshots, then
1.2.3rc7 for release candidates, then
1.2.3 for releases,

in that order.  This is the syntax preferred by Python tools like pip.

The Debian syntax requires a ~ to sort before empty, so the
corresponding Debian versions would be

1.2.3~a20170328
1.2.3~rc7
1.2.3

but since packaging of a particular version may change, Debian
packages have an additional version following a hyphen, e.g. 1.2.3-4
or 1.2.3~rc7-4, starting at 1.

Since we do not operate the Debian or Ubuntu repositories, but
conceivably someone might take our packaging and put it in the Debian
or Ubuntu repository (perhaps with their own tweaks), we add our own
probcomp-private suffix, again with a ~ to sort before the package
version, and tagged with the numeric Ubuntu release for which the
package was built:

1.2.3~a20170328-4~probcomp1ubuntu14.04
1.2.3~rc7-4~probcomp1ubuntu14.04
1.2.3-4~probcomp1ubuntu14.04

We tag these with the numeric Ubuntu release for which the package was
built in order to allow different builds of the same software for
different Ubuntu versions, in the same package archive.  The program
that manages package archives, reprepro, refuses to store different
instances of the same version of the same package in the same package
archive.

export DEBEMAIL='Ronald T Frobnitz <frobnitz+probcomp@csail.mit.edu>'

# Create a new changelog.
dch -c xyz/changelog --create

# Update version to 0.1.2-3.
# - Be sure to include Debian version suffix -- the `-3' part.
# - Debian versions start at `-1'.
# - rc, a, &c., need `~' prefix, e.g. 0.1.2~rc3-1.
# - Include the `~probcomp1ubuntu14.04' tag as well.
# Editor will pop up; edit and exit when satisfied with changelog message.
dch -c xyz/changelog -v 0.1.2-3~probcomp1ubuntu14.04

# Commit the changelog entry and set the OS distribution to `trusty'.
dch -c xyz/changelog --distribution trusty --release

* pbuilder hacks

Add to ~/.pbuilderrc:

    # Work around Debian bug #725434.
    export TMPDIR=/tmp

    # Enable universe packages too.
    COMPONENTS="main universe"

    # Implement setting of DIST to OS distribution version.
    if [ -n "${DIST-}" ]; then
	BASETGZ="$(dirname "$BASETGZ")/${DIST}-$(basename "$BASETGZ")"
	DISTRIBUTION="$DIST"
	BUILDRESULT="/var/cache/pbuilder/${DIST}/result"
	APTCACHE="/var/cache/pbuilder/${DIST}/aptcache"
    fi
