Debian packaging for the MIT Probabilistic Computing Project.

Each subdirectory is the `debian/' directory for a single package.
There are also scripts to help build packages:

- build.sh: build .deb packages
- publish.sh: sign and publish .deb packages to a reprepro repository

* build.sh: build .deb packages

Usage: build.sh [-hn] [-O <objdir>] [-d <debdir>] [-r <repo>] [-t <tag>]

  -h                show help
  -n                dry run
  -O <objdir>       build <objdir>/foo_1.23.amd64.deb
  -d <debdir>       use <debdir>/control, default is .
  -r <repo>         build from Git repository <repo>
  -t <tag>          build from Git tag <tag>

The build.sh script will use sudo to install build dependencies.
Running in a chroot, e.g. by integrating it with pbuilder, is left as
an exercise for the reader.

Example:

% ./build.sh -O obj -d venture -r /home/me/venture -t release-0.4.1-rc-6

(The tag is necessary in this case because Venture does not follow the
`v<version>' pattern, e.g. v0.4.1-rc-6, for naming tags, which the
other repositories do.)

The tag must match what is in <debdir>/changelog; if not, update the
latter before building.

The resulting .deb package will go in obj/.

* publish.sh: sign and publish .deb packages to a reprepro repository

Usage: publish.sh [-hn] [-O <objdir>] [-b <basedir>] [-c <codename>]

  -h                show help
  -n                dry run
  -O <objdir>       publish <objdir>/foo_1.23.amd64.deb
  -b <basedir>      base of repository to publish to
  -c <codename>     codename of OS release, e.g. `trusty'

Example:

% ./publish.sh -O obj -b /var/www/data/ubuntu -c trusty

The publish.sh script will sign packages using the GnuPG key specified
in the reprepro repository's conf/distributions file.
