Jenkins on probcomp-4 expects this script to be in ~jenkins/prereqs_wrapper.sh
so installation means copying it there.

Jenkins also expects the result of build-venv to be in
0.1.3-prereqs-venv, and the pip-install jenkins job tests that
build-venv plus pip installs works and tests pass with the v0.1.3 tag.

Most jenkins shell execution scripts should look something like:

  set -eux
  /var/lib/jenkins/prereqs_wrapper.sh crosscat bayeslite-apsw bayeslite bdbcontrib ./check.sh tests

The effect of that is to ensure that we're using the environment that
build-venv built, with each of the mentioned dependencies being at
head instead.
